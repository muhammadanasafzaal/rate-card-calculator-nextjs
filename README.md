## üöÄ Deployment

This application is designed to be easily deployed to Vercel.

1.  **Create a Vercel Project:**
    *   Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    *   Import your Git repository (e.g., from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2.  **Configure Environment Variables on Vercel:**
    *   During the deployment setup on Vercel, you will be prompted to add environment variables. Add all the variables from your `.env.local` file (except those prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` which are automatically exposed).
    *   Ensure you add them as "Production" and "Development" (and "Preview" if applicable) variables.

3.  **Link Supabase (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Vercel has a direct integration with Supabase. You can link your Supabase project during the deployment setup, and Vercel will automatically configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for you.

4.  **Deploy:**
    *   Once configured, deploy your project. Vercel will build and deploy your Next.js application.

Your application will be live at the Vercel URL provided after a successful deployment!
